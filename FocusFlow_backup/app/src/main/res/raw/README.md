## Audio Resources

This directory contains the audio files used for background sounds during focus sessions.

### Files:
- `nature_sounds.mp3`: Nature ambient sounds for focus (forest, rain, etc.)
- `binaural_beats.mp3`: Binaural beats to help with focus and concentration
- `white_noise.mp3`: White noise for masking distracting background sounds

Note: In a production app, these would be actual audio files. For this project, these are placeholders. In a real implementation, you would need to add properly licensed audio files or generate them programmatically.
